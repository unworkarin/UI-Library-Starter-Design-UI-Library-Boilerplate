# UI Library Starter — Design / UI Library Boilerplate

A minimal, well-documented starter repository for building a Design System / UI Component Library in React + Tailwind CSS.
This repo is ready for GitHub Sponsors and includes a demo app, components, tests, and build scripts.

## What's included
- `packages/ui` — a small component library (Button, Card, ThemeProvider)
- `apps/demo` — a demo app to preview and test components
- `README.md` — this file
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- `package.json` — workspace scripts using pnpm (or you can use npm/yarn)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — starter changelog

## Quick start (using npm)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Run the demo:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Build the library:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Why this repo
This starter gives you a clean structure to:
- Publish `@unworkarin/ui` to npm (or keep it private for GitHub Sponsors)
- Add more components and documentation site (Storybook / Docz)
- Integrate design tokens and automated releases
